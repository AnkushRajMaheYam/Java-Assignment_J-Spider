# Java Assignments: J-Spider Software Training Institute

This repository contains a collection of Java programming assignments from the **J-Spider Software Training Institute** (Noida Branch). Each assignment focuses on different aspects of Java, including method implementation, conditional logic, loops, and problem-solving techniques.

## Repository Structure

Each assignment is stored in a separate folder named according to the assignment number (e.g., `Assign6`, `Assign7`, etc.). Inside each folder, you will find Java code files that solve specific problems given in the assignments.

### Folder Structure

```
Java-Assignment_J-Spider/
    ├── Assign6/
    │   └── Assign6.java
    ├── Assign7/
    │   └── Assign7.java
    └── (Future Assignments will be added in separate folders)
```

### Example Folders

#### Folder: Assign6

The **Assign6** folder contains the following Java problems:

1. **Check if Number is Even or Odd**  
   A method to check whether a number is even or odd.

2. **Check Leap Year**  
   A method to determine whether a given year is a leap year.

3. **Sum of N Natural Numbers**
