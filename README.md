# Java Assignments: J-Spider Software Training Institute

This repository contains a collection of Java programming assignments from the **J-Spider Software Training Institute** (Noida Branch). Each assignment focuses on different aspects of Java, including method implementation, conditional logic, loops, and problem-solving techniques.

## Repository Structure

Each assignment is stored in a separate folder named according to the assignment number (e.g., `Assign6`, `Assign7`, etc.). Inside each folder, you will find Java code files that solve specific problems given in the assignments.

### Folder Structure

```
Java-Assignment_J-Spider/
    ├── Assign6/
    │   └── Assign6.java
    ├── Assign7/
    │   └── Assign7.java
    └── (Future Assignments will be added in separate folders)
```

### Example Folders

#### Folder: Assign6

The **Assign6** folder contains the following Java problems:

1. **Check if Number is Even or Odd**  
   A method to check whether a number is even or odd.

2. **Check Leap Year**  
   A method to determine whether a given year is a leap year.

3. **Sum of N Natural Numbers**  
   A method to compute the sum of the first N natural numbers.

4. **Factorial of a Number**  
   A method to calculate the factorial of a given number.

5. **Print Fibonacci Series**

#### Folder: Assign7

The **Assign7** folder contains the following Java problems:

1. **Average of Three Numbers**  
   A method that accepts three numbers and returns their average.
   
2. **Check Number Nature (Positive, Negative, or Zero)**  
   A method to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

3. **Equality Check for Three Numbers**

   A method to find the largest of three numbers.

6. **Triangle Validity Check**  
   A method to check if three sides form a valid triangle.

7. **Triangle Type (Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene)**  
   A method to classify the type of triangle based on its sides.

8. **Age Difference Between Three Brothers**  
   A method to calculate the age difference between the oldest and youngest brother.

9. **Calculate Discounted Price**  
   A method that calculates the price after applying a percentage discount.

10. **Sum of Digits of a Three-Digit Number**  
   A method to return the sum of the digits of a three-digit number.
