## Questions

1. Print all digit one by one

2. Print all even digits

3. Print all digits greater or equal to 5

4. Print biggest digit

5. Print the diff. of biggest and smallest digit

6. Count total no of digits

7. Count all Even digits 

8. Count all digits which is 0 or 1

9. Print Sum of all digits

10. Print sum of all Even digits

11. Print sum of all digits which are grater than 5

12. Print whether sum of all digits are Even or not

13. Print Product of all digits other than zero

14. Print the factorial of each digits of the number

15. Print factorial of all even digits of number.

16. print the sum of factorials of all digits of number.

17. Print whether the no. is a Strong number or not Strong no 

A **Strong Number** is a special number where the sum of the factorials of its digits is equal to the original number. 

---

### **Example**:
- Consider \( 145 \):
  - \( 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 \)
  - Since the sum of the factorials of its digits equals the original number, \( 145 \) is a **Strong Number**.

---

### **Steps to Check if a Number is a Strong Number**:
1. Extract each digit of the number.
2. Compute the factorial of each digit.
3. Add the factorials.
4. Compare the sum with the original number.

18. WAJP to reverse and print the value

19. WAJP to check whether the no. is palindrome number or not.

A **palindrome number** is a number that reads the same backward as forward. In other words, if you reverse the digits of the number, it remains unchanged.

---

### **Examples**:
1. \( 121 \): Reversed, it is still \( 121 \).
2. \( 12321 \): Reversed, it is \( 12321 \).
3. \( 3443 \): Reversed, it is \( 3443 \).

### **Non-Palindrome Examples**:
1. \( 123 \): Reversed, it becomes \( 321 \).
2. \( 4567 \): Reversed, it becomes \( 7654 \).

---

### **Steps to Check if a Number is a Palindrome**:
1. Extract the digits of the number.
2. Reverse the digits.
3. Compare the reversed number with the original number:
   - If they are the same, the number is a **palindrome**.
   - Otherwise, it is not.
