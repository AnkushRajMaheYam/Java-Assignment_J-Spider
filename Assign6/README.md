# Java Programming Assignment: Method Implementation

This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate method creation and usage. The programs solve various problems related to basic arithmetic, comparisons, character validation, triangle validation, and divisibility checks, all while emphasizing the use of methods in Java.

## Contents

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   - Methods to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers.
   
2. **Sum of Squares of Last Two Digits**
   - A method that calculates the sum of squares of the last two digits of a number.
   
3. **Square of the Largest Number**
   - A method to print the square of the largest of two numbers.
   
4. **Print Smaller of Two Numbers**
   - A method that takes two numbers and prints the smaller one.
   
5. **Print Smallest of Three Numbers**
   - A method that prints the smallest of three numbers.
   
6. **Character or Numeric Value Identification**
   - A method to check if the input is a numeric character (0-9) or another character.
   
7. **Triangle Validation**
   - A method that verifies whether the given sides form a valid triangle.
   
8. **Number Nature Check (+ve, -ve, or Zero)**
   - A method that determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
   
9. **Divisibility by 8**
   - A method that checks if a number is divisible by 8.
   
10. **Check if Number Ends with 8**
    - A method to verify if a number ends with the digit 8.
   
11. **Check if Last Two Digits are Divisible by 6**
    - A method that checks if the last two digits of a number are divisible by 6.

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnkushRajMaheYam/Java-Assignment_J-Spider.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Java-Assignment_J-Spider/Assign6
   ```

3. Compile the program using the Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac Assign6.java
   ```

4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Assign6
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to test each method by inputting the required values.

## Tech Stack
